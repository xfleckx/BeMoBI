# BeMoBI
The first implementation of an experiment using the BeMoBI Framework

It implements a spatial navigation paradigm as an example.

## Features
Providing a Spatial cognition paradigm to show how such a thing could implemented with Unity3D

## Setup

### Submodules [optional]
Only necessary when your working with the git commandline tools!
After cloning this repository, call:

> git submodule init; git submodule update

To get the BeMoBI.Unity3D framework and the LSL4Unity components through a submodule reference to their latest versions.

### Oculus VR Unity Integration
The project works with the latest OVR Runtime (0.8.x) and the Oculus Utilities for Unity3D

## major issues
Currently only Windows >= 7 is supported to run the project! 

Reasons:
 - current version of OVR SDK and Runtime supports only Windows :/
 - the current maintainer of the project has no Mac environment available to test and build anything...
 
# Other Dependencies
the current master branch has no PhaseSpace integrated - this will be changed in the near future
